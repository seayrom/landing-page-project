# landing-page-project

This is the final project in the odin project foundations course

My goal is to be able to create a replica of the page provided not necessarily getting everything to pixel perfection. I want to also hone my ability to search for solutions to peculiar problems with my code.

**First** I will build the general outline of my page and then I'll follow it up with the individual sections. I'll document my challenges along the way.

**Things Noted**
At this point I am wondering how the placeholder was put in the middle of the image box.

After some digging I realized the the box there is not actually an image but is likely an empty div because an image tag without href should display the usual thumbnail and that's what I did in my work.

In the second section I faced some difficulties but I didn't need to research to resolve any problem I encountered.

The third section proved a bit of challenge because I was finding it difficult to align the "source of quote" part to the left and found it challenging but once again some googling helped.

The fourth section came very easy to me. I realize I will have to reformat my css to remove repetitive declarations to make my code simpler. Google and chrome dev tools has been a great help.

Found the footer section very easy too

**Things Completed**
I was able to add the basic structure of the header section.
Second Section complete
Third Section done!!
Fourth Section complete
Footer Section finally done

**Final thoughts**
I finally finished the project and as I said in the beginning I wanted to build a replica of the page provided and I tried to do that the best I could. In the process I was able to google things like:

1. Making corner of element borders rounded
2. Using the :nth of type Pseudo class selector
3. Making my image place holder since I didn't use an image file

I also see how useful dev-tools can be in debugging my code
