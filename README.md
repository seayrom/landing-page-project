# landing-page-project

This is the final project in the odin project foundations course

My goal is to be able to create a replica of the page provided not necessarily getting everything to pixel perfection. I want to also hone my ability to search for solutions to peculiar problems with my code.

**First** I will build the general outline of my page and then I'll follow it up with the individual sections. I'll document my challenges along the way.

**Things Noted**
At this point I am wondering how the placeholder was put in the middle of the image box.

After some digging I realized the the box there is not actually an image but is likely an empty div because an image tag without href should display the usual thumbnail and that's what I did in my work.

In the second section I faced some difficulties but I didn't need to research to resolve any problem I encountered.

The third section proved a bit of challenge because I was finding it difficult to align the "source of quote" part to the left and found it challenging but once again some googling helped.

**Things Completed**
I was able to add the basic structure of the header section.
Second Section complete
Third Section done!!
